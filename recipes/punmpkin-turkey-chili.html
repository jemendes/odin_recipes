        <h2>This turkey pumpkin chili is absolutely delicious. It's quick and easy, too!</h2>

        <p>This is a pretty straightforward pumpkin turkey chili recipe. Adding pumpkin to chili adds a lovely sweetness and depth of flavor. You do want to cook it for at least an hour, or ideally allow it to simmer on low for several hours. The longer it cooks the better the texture will be.</p>
