        <h2>This Baked Ziti is absolutely delicious. It's quick and easy, too!</h2>

        <p>Baked Ziti is one of those easy casseroles that tastes like you’ve been cooking all day long but it’s surprisingly quick! Layers of tender ziti noodles, with a meaty zesty Italian sausage sauce and a cream creamy ricotta cheese layer. Top it all with a generous helping of mozzarella cheese and bake until bubbly. An amazing meal in about an hour!</p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>

        <ul>

            <li>1 ½ cups sour cream</li>
            <li>6 ounces mozzarella cheese, shredded</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons grated Parmesan cheese</li>
